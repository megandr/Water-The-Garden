# Water-The-Garden
Outlet, switch or valve controller that reads humidity and turns on a switch or opens a valve to water your garden. Includes Dark Sky API to check if rain is coming and will override the watering cycle if desired. Executes on sensor events, which PlantLink reports every 15 minutes. If a wateringcycle is running for a period longer than the reporting period, new events are ignored until the first cycle is complete.
